At very beginning I started to think about the language syntax, what will be the reserved keywords and symbols such like as assignment operator (most language uses '=') and actually I lost hours thinking about that until I realize that I have a way more important decisions to make. And then I put all this mess stuff in my mind on a note to organize and decide what I need to decide first.

There are two major types of languages: the **interpreted** ones and the **compiled** ones.
