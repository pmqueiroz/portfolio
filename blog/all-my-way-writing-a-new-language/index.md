In fact I'm a web developer but at some point I realized that I must learn more about low level computer science, indeed I have no patience to learn all this matter in college at all. So I decide to make things more practices and write a new language implementation and I will document **all my way** through this challenge here.

```js
   const salve = 'font'
```
