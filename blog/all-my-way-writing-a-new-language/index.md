One thing that fascinates me in programming language is the syntax, most time I started to 'play' with a language was because of it, sometimes I thought it simple and easy or even complicated and fulfilled of weirdo characters, both bring me attention. But more important than how code will be written each language has major features underneath. In my opinion developers generally don't even know for what purpose the language that their language was created for *<s>including me</s>*. In fact I'm a web developer but at some point I realized that I must learn more about low level computer science, indeed I have no patience to learn all this matter in college at all. So I decide to make things more practices and write a new language implementation and I will document **all my way** through this challenge here.

Fun fact: until then the name of my language will be Umbra, asking why? I don't know either ðŸ˜…. Umbra was the name of an old project of mine that I didn't keep so I sort of stole the name, I think it's cool.
