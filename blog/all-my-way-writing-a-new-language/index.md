One thing that fascinates me in programming language is the syntax, most time I started to 'play' with a language was because of it, sometimes I thought it simple and easy or even complicated and fulfilled of weirdo characters, both bring me attention.
But more important than how code will be written, each language has major features underneath.
In my opinion developers generally don't even know for what purpose the language that their language was created for, *<s>including me</s>*.
In fact I'm a web developer but at some point I realized that I must learn more about low level computer science, and I have no patience to learn all this matter in college.
So I decide to make things more practices and write a language from scratch and I will document **all my way** through this challenge here, you may expect a history.

I don't have high hopes doing this, is more for fun and probably I will leave this ideia aside or spend years until get something working minimally.

> Future me: It's have been three years until something really work

Fun fact: until then the name of my language will be Umbra, asking why? I don't know either ðŸ˜…. Umbra was the name of an old project of mine that I didn't keep so I sort of stole myself the name, I think it's cool.
